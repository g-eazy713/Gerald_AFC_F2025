//DECOMPOSITION

// We need to find the area of a geometric shape

//What do we need to think about?

//Do functions exist?
//What shape are we working with (different formulas)

//Function takes two arguments. First argument takes a String with a name of shape.
//Second argument takes an Array of values

//Test if first argument is a string
// probably needs a list to select from

//Test if Second argument is an array
// is an empty array the same as no array?

//Array exist and has values?
